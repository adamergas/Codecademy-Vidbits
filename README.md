The Vidbits capstone for the Test Driven Development class

Heyo!
To make this application work:
1. run mongod.exe 
2. open command window, navigate to file directory and 'npm start'
3. open web browser and navigate to 'localhost:4001'

To run the tests:
1. open another command window, navigate to file directory and 'npm run test'

Notes:
1. I separated some of the tests into separate, appropriately named files.
2. There seemed to be several typos in the follow-along steps, I proceeded how I assumed the directions meant.
